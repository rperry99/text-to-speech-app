# text-to-speech-app

This is an app created from [Brad Traversy's Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/ZORXxxP49G8?list=WL)

## What does it do?

You can type in the words / phrases you want, and the computer will read them back to you. <br>
You can also change the rate and the pitch of the voice and the voice itself. <br><br>
It uses the "speechSynthesis" API to select voices and speak them.
